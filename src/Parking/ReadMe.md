# About this application
This is a coding assessment, application's main functionality to help users to park their vehicle. 
The user can login and also creates a new user and delete the existing user as well. 
Once user login, the application shows the parking locations on a map. Tap on the parking location shows the information about that location.
If the user selects that location then the user can start parking over there. The user can see the parking histories and actions as well.

# Development Environment
    Xcode - 9.3
    iOS SDK - 11.3
    Language - swift (4.1)
    Deployment Target - 10.0 and later

# ThirdParty Libraries/Frameworks
    * Nothing
    * Hamburger menu & Annotation icons are took from internet

#  Design Approches
    * MVVM pattern
    * Tired to stick on S.O.L.I.D principles

# Testing Enviroment
    The project not followed the Test Driven Development practice. 
    But I have added few unit test case I couldn't add more due to the time box and my office working hours. 
    I would not use any unit test framework for mocking (Quick/Nimble) the network modules. 
    The application is only tested on iOS simulator (iPhone 8/8+). 

# Questions
    * Hamburger menu is against to iOS human interface designing.
    * Lack of information about the web services and inconsistency in response data fields (I am new to FireBase cloud service, maybe that's why I feel like this). 
    * Small suggestion, this assessment is quite big, If I am in your shoes, I will give a small assessment because I want to know the coding skills and project design capabilities of the candidate.

# Bugs
* I didn't find any bugs at the testing time.

# Incompleted/Pending Functionalities
    * Hamburger menu
    * Start Parking
    * Stop Parking
    * Parking History
    * Logout
    * User Profile
    * Add New Vehicel

# My Opinion About Code
    * I am happy about the assessment always there is room to improve the code standards and design as well, I am looking forward your review comments.
    * I didn't use the advanced techniques of Swift because I am an intermediate level in Swift because in my current project we are heavily using the Objective-C.
